Expo Router - File Based Routing for React Native, tabs template with auth flow using context api


This is source code from the video on [Expo Router v2](https://blog.expo.dev/introducing-expo-router-v2-3850fd5c3ca1)

In the video, I walk you through the code for an authentication flow using [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/routing/introduction/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). 

I explain how to set up the environment variables, install the router, and incorporate Apprite as the authentication provider. I also demonstrate how to create login and signup pages, manage authentication state, and handle navigation. 

The video provides a step-by-step guide with code examples and explanations. Check it out to learn how to build a secure authentication flow for your Expo app!
